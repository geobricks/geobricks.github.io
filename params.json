[internal page](test.md)\r\n\r\nQuick start: Download MODIS tiles\r\n---------------------------------\r\n```python\r\nfrom geobricks_downloader.download.downloader import Downloader\r\n\r\n\r\nlayers_to_be_downloaded = [\r\n    {\r\n        'file_name': 'my_modis_tile.hdf',\r\n        'file_path': 'ftp://ladsweb.nascom.nasa.gov/allData/5/MOD13Q1/2014/001/MOD13Q1.A2014001.h02v08.005.2014018082809.hdf'\r\n    }\r\n]\r\ntarget = '/home/user/Desktop'\r\nd = Downloader('modis', target, layers_to_be_downloaded)\r\nd.download()\r\n```\r\nThe `layers_to_be_downloaded` variable is a Python array, and each element must have the following structure:\r\n```python\r\n{\r\n    'file_path': 'ftp://path/to/your/resource',\r\n    'file_name': 'my_modis_tile.hdf'\r\n}\r\n```\r\nwhere `file_path` is the URL to the remote resource to be downloaded and `file_name` is the name of the file that will be stored on the local file system. This method is quite tedious and not very convenient. The best way to take advantage of the Geobricks Downloader is through the use of its plug-ins, as described in the next example.","google":"UA-54093846-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
